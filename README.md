## Description 
This web application is a quiz on CSS, HTML and JavaScript fundamentals. 

The purpose of the application is to showcase a quiz demo, as the quiz is currently limited to 10 questions. The number of questions currently included could be expanded upon in future, to improve the quality of the quiz, with regards to the topics covered.

The application files could also be used by those learning to code, who would like to test their knowledge. The quiz can be taken as is, but it also affords the option of expanding the questions base (by downloading the files). It can serve as a fun exercise to store the knowledge gained as they learn and review it at later date by taking the quiz.

This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## Usage 

<br />

<div align="center">
  <img src=".\assets\images\home-page.png" alt="The screenshot displays the home page, showing a start button to begin the quiz." style="width: 80%"/>
</div>

<br />

From the landing page press `Start`; the questions will be shown a multiple-choice format.

<br />

<div align="center">
  <img src=".\assets\images\question-example-with-feedback.png" alt="Application question window with multiple choices, displaying 'Correct!' feedback." style="width: 80%"/>
</div>


<br />

CLick on the answer of your choosing to advance to the next question.

The quiz operates on a timer (top left corner of the screen). Your final score will be dependent on the time left when you run out of questions. - However, don't rush! With every wrong answer clicked you will knock 10s off the timer; if the timer runs out - you loose!

Feedback will be displayed and a sound effect will play, to inform you on wether you got the question right or wrong.

Upon completing the last question, the user will be taken to the end screen, where they will be afforded the chance to log their score to be stored to the scoreboard in the browser's Local Storage.

<br />

<div align="center">
  <img src=".\assets\images\end-page-initials-input.png" alt="Quiz end page displaying score and the option to store the score with the user's initials." style="width: 80%"/>
</div>

<br />

The user will then be redirected automatically to the Highscores page to see how they measured up to the top 10 best players who came before.

<br />

<div align="center">
  <img src=".\assets\images\highscore-leaderboard.png" alt="High score leader board displayed, with options to go back to the home page or clear the leader board." style="width: 80%"/>
</div>

<br />

From the highscores page you can either press `Go Back` to return to the home page and start a new quiz, or `Clear Highscores` to clear the scoreboard.
